Some things I have learned so far is how biofarmatics works and how danny uses it in the dennis lab. Also how github.com website works like a digital lab notebook.
We learned that saving changes are know as commits in github and making it a file it has to have a specific letters at the end so the file displayes it right. 
To make any changes you have to provide reasoning at the bottom so the website can identify why your making these changes.

Did a Markdown Tutorial with Italicas and Bold, Headers, Links, Images, Blockquotes, Lists, and Paragraphs.

Italicas, you use _what ever wording here then another_ underscore to make the wording red.

Bold, you just capitalizes all the lettering. HELLO 

Headers to make them in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark aka (#). Also place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want.

Links, there are two different types in Markdown, both of them render the exact same way. The first link is called inline link you create this you wrap the link text in brackets ([]), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis. 

Images, to make them you put an ! point in front of your ![Tiger](https://i.natgeofe.com/n/6490d605-b11a-4919-963e-f1e6f3c0d4b6/sumatran-tiger-thumbnail-nationalgeographic_1456276.jpg?w=1200) and the image of your animal or thing pops up. 

Blockquotes, its a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader. 

Lists, thereare two types unordered and ordered. Unordered lists ar with bullet points and ordered lists are with numbers.To create an unordered list, you'll have to preface each item in the list with an asterisk ( * ). Each list item also gets its own line. To have an ordered lists, you'll put each number then what ever's in that lists and put equal space apart. 

Paragraphs, accomplish this by inserting two spaces after each new line.

Chromosome X is were my CNKSR2 gene is. 

Gene upstream are RPS6KA3 and downstream are KLHL34, MBTPS2, and SMPX. 

Diseases. None. 

Tissue with highest expression is brian cerebellar hemisphere.

We are doing coding with R 
1: Basic Building Blocks      2: Workspace and Files     
 3: Sequences of Numbers       4: Vectors                 
 5: Missing Values             6: Subsetting Vectors      
 7: Matrices and Data Frames   8: Logic                   
 9: Functions                 10: lapply and sapply       
11: vapply and tapply         12: Looking at Data         
13: Simulation                14: Dates and Times         
15: Base Graphics             
So far I have done 1, 2, and 3. 

##Swirl Math operations

**up arrow and tab**
> * arrow up is to go up and change any mistakes
> * tab is to check variables

We did more coding with Sean though, but we did gene data into R. We learned how to make boxplot with our gene's tissue. Then we made one in a colorfull way were you can see what CNKSR2 gene tissues are the highest in the brain. 

Then we did some coding to make all are data into a female and male digital diagram were you can see the brain is most used for the gene CNSKR2.

Some things I have learned so far is how biofarmatics works and how danny uses it in the dennis lab. Also how github.com website works like a digital lab notebook.
We learned that saving changes are know as commits in github and making it a file it has to have a specific letters at the end so the file displayes it right. 
To make any changes you have to provide reasoning at the bottom so the website can identify why your making these changes.

Some things I have learned so far is how biofarmatics works and how danny uses it in the dennis lab. Also how github.com website works like a digital lab notebook.
We learned that saving changes are know as commits in github and making it a file it has to have a specific letters at the end so the file displayes it right. 
To make any changes you have to provide reasoning at the bottom so the website can identify why your making these changes.

Did a Markdown Tutorial with Italicas and Bold, Headers, Links, Images, Blockquotes, Lists, and Paragraphs.

Italicas, you use _what ever wording here then another_ underscore to make the wording red.

Bold, you just capitalizes all the lettering. HELLO 

Headers to make them in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark aka (#). Also place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want.

Links, there are two different types in Markdown, both of them render the exact same way. The first link is called inline link you create this you wrap the link text in brackets ([]), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis. 

Images, to make them you put an ! point in front of your ![Tiger]([https://i.natgeofe.com/n/6490d605-b11a-4919-963e-f1e6f3c0d4b6/sumatran-tiger-thumbnail-nationalgeographic_1456276.jpg?w=1200]) and the image of your animal or thing pops up. 

Blockquotes, its a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader. 

Lists, thereare two types unordered and ordered. Unordered lists ar with bullet points and ordered lists are with numbers.To create an unordered list, you'll have to preface each item in the list with an asterisk ( * ). Each list item also gets its own line. To have an ordered lists, you'll put each number then what ever's in that lists and put equal space apart. 

Paragraphs, accomplish this by inserting two spaces after each new line.
